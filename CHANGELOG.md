# v3.0.0
## Update build system
After this, the build won't need to be done manually.
On merge circleCI will:
 - build the project and publish it to github and npm
 - update the demo pages and publish it

In order to publish to npm, the project is also renamed to @transferwise/styleguide-components.
The README is also updated to reflect these changes.
