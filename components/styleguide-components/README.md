## Releasing

In order to release a new version, here are the steps necessary:

1. **Build your files and commit them**

    Simply running `npm start` will build them, then you should see changes in `/dist`, you should commit both source and distribution files.

2. **Run the tests**

    `npm test` will do the trick but make sure you run these after building the `/dist` files

3. **Bump the version in `package.json`**

    Recommended to stick to semver for this: http://semver.org

4. **Make a pull request**

    You will need a review from a member of the @transferwise/frontend-guild.

5. **Squash WIP commits and merge**

    Delete your branch after merging.

6. **Send out a new release**

    Go to https://github.com/transferwise/styleguide-components/releases/new, write a good title and description, ask someone what they think and then release ðŸš€

7. **Update the documentation**

        cd gh-pages
        git checkout gh-pages
